This is a very simple script which goes through your most recent
timeline, counts tweets for each user and tells you who's been tweeting
more.

It's useful to figure out who's noisier in your recent timeline when
you've noticed there's way too much going on, and can be helpful if you
want to unfollow or mute them temporarily.

# How?

Follow the instructions at
https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens
and get your tokens.

Clone this repo.

Fill in the variables in the code.

Run `npm install`.

Run `node index.js`

The script will output the results and dump them into a text file.

# Can't you make this nicer/better?

Maybe some day. This is literally a 10/20 mins thing I made when my
timeline was too noisy and I wanted to figure out who was tweeting so
much.
